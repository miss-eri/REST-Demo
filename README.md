Hi There! Miss Eri here. If you are a beginner in Spring, Java or SpringBoot. or Programming in general this a great project for you to start getting familiar with the languages.
You can find the Official Docunentations here. 

Remember: *understanding the rules of a game makes it easier to play, is the same for programmming languages so don't hesitate on reading thoroughly the official documentation for any project you are working on 
(even when sometimes it can be more confusing lol)*

- [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [H2 DB Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
- [Junit for testing](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)


## What does this project do?
This project is a very VERY Basic example of a REST service using Springboot and H2 as a test DB, if you would like to understand more about what REST is you can do it by watching this 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUbt-Qp6Pg) by Web Dev Simplified. In this project we are taking the role of a company in need of a service to manage the employee information. 

On this Project we are going to be able to do some operations known as CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) we will also have unit testing for each method.
